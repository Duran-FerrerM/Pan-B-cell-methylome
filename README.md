# The proliferative history shapes the DNA methylome of B-cell tumors and predicts clinical outcome

## Abstract
We report a systematic analysis of the DNA methylation variability in 1,595 samples of normal cell subpopulations and 14 tumor subtypes spanning the entire human B-cell lineage. Differential methylation among tumor entities relates to differences in cellular origin and to de novo epigenetic alterations, which allowed us to build an accurate machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm. We identify extensive patient-specific methylation variability in silenced chromatin associated with the proliferative history of normal and neoplastic B cells. Mitotic activity generally leaves both hyper- and hypomethylation imprints, but some B-cell neoplasms preferentially gain or lose DNA methylation. Subsequently, we construct a DNA methylation-based mitotic clock called epiCMIT, whose lapse magnitude represents a strong independent prognostic variable in B-cell tumors and is associated with particular driver genetic alterations. Our findings reveal DNA methylation as a holistic tracer of B-cell tumor developmental history, with implications in the differential diagnosis and prediction of clinical outcome.

### epiCMIT mitotic clock calculator 
#### Illumina 450k and EPIC arrays currently supported. An epiCMIT based on Next Generation Sequencing will be introduced very soon. Please, feel free to contact me if you have NGS-based data.
The epiCMIT (epigenetically-determined Cumulative MIToses) mitotic clock represents a relative measure of the total proliferative history of normal and neoplastic B cells. It is build considering the highest score from their two underlying hyper- and hypomethylation-based mitotic clocks, called epiCMIT-hyper and the epiCMIT-hypo, respectively. The code we provide here calculates the three mitotic clocks for each sample. All of them range from 0 to 1, depending on low or high realtive proliferative history. Based on our data, considering hyper- or hypomethyaltion separately may not be sufficient to capture the entire mitotic history of cancer cells. We performed a comprehensive selection of CpGs to buid the epiCMIT and showed it as an accurate mitotic clock for normal and neoplastic B cells. Nonetheless, given our careful CpG filtering we strongly belive that epiCMIT represent a pan-cancer mitotic clock.  
  
As a final note, the proliferative history of B-cell tumors include the proliferative history of normal B-cell development and the proliferative history of malignant transformation and progression. The epiCMIT should be compared then among B-cell tumors with the same cellular origin.

### Pan B-cell tumor classifier algorithm
B-cell tumors comprise a variety of neoplasias derived from normal B cells of the heamopoietic system. Collectively, ALL, MCL, CLL, DLBCL and MM represent the majority of diagnosed B-cell neoplasias. They are further classified in subtypes with different clinicobiological features. The code we provide here represents a Pan B-cell tumor classifier algorithm, which contains two steps: in the firt step, an unknown sample is classified into one of the five major B-cell tumor entities; in the second step, these major entities are further classified into their subtypes. If prior knowledge of the entity is avaialble, we recommend to specify it to the classifier algorithm.

Current version: v.1.0.
